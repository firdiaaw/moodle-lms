Requires at least Praktomat Version 4.18

The ProForma Moodle Question Type is a Moodle Plugin that is used for 
automatically grading programming questions in Moodle quizzes. Questions are 
internally stored in the ProFormA format (https://github.com/ProFormA/proformaxml). 

Tests are run on a back-end system (test runner) that also conforms to the 
ProFormA standard (https://github.com/ProFormA/proformaxml) version 2: Praktomat (https://github.com/elearning-ostfalia/Proforma-Praktomat).


![system architecture](doc/architecture.png "System architecture")

Standard test frameworks are used for specifying tests. Currently the following programming languages and test frameworks are supported:

- Java: JUnit 4, JUnit 5, Checkstyle
- C++: GoogleTest (with CMake/Makefile)
- c: GoogleTest, CUnit (with CMake/Makefile)
- Python: Python Unittest, Python Doctest
- (Setlx: Test, Syntax Check)

Any other  programming language resp. test framework can be used as long as Praktomat 
supports it. Since all code is open source, it can be easily extended to other languages and frameworks.

The plugin comes with a built-in question editor. 
Most questions can be created in Moodle with the built-in editor. 
More complex questions can be created outside of the system with a stand-alone editor 
(https://proforma.github.io/formatEditor/proformaEditor.html) or by other means 
(e.g. script). These questions can be imported by use of another Moodle plugin.
The stand-alone editor is also included in this plugin for "ProFormA" questions. 

Copyright note: The renderer code partly bases upon the renderer from essay question type (Moodle core).
Small code parts (in particular in qbehaviour_adaptiveexternalgrading) are copied from Coderunner 
(https://moodle.org/plugins/qtype_coderunner). The bulktester code bases on same part in Stack.
  
## Features

- various submission formats: 
    
    * editor with programming language support such as syntax highlighting or automatic indentation
    * explorer/IDE-like environment for creating and editing multiple files, also with programming language support
    * file upload (for more than one file)
    * external repository (git or SVN) 
  
- code snippet as starting point for student in editor
- immediate feedback for students (optional) 
- supported programming languages are only limited by the available grader back-ends 

Please note that when completing a quiz attempt, you may see the message 'questions without a response'.
Questions are considered unanswered even if the answer is not correct. 
This is a characteristic of 'adaptive' behavior and can also be observed with other question types.

Alternative: Simple file explorer if the response consists of more than one file:

## Installation

####  Prerequisites 

The ProFormA question type requires:

- the Moodle plugin `qbehaviour_adaptiveexternalgrading`
(https://github.com/elearning-ostfalia/moodle-qbehaviour_adaptiveexternalgrading) for 
question engine adaptation and

- a ProFromA grading back-end to run the tests.  
`ProFormA-Praktomat` (https://github.com/elearning-ostfalia/Proforma-Praktomat) is recommended.

Currently only simple Java and SetlX (https://randoom.org/Software/SetlX/) questions can be created straight in Moodle. Note that SetlX is disabled by default.

For importing questions from an external source an import plugin is available (optional):   

- Moodle-Plugin `qformat_proforma` (import for ProFormA questions)

We have a separate Javascript editor for creating tasks (https://github.com/ProFormA/formatEditor). An online version is available at 
https://proforma.github.io/formatEditor/proformaEditor.html
       
Of course ProFormA tasks can be created by different other external tools as well.


In order to download all students' submissions for e.g. checking for plagiats the plugins 

* `proformasubmexport`: https://github.com/elearning-ostfalia/moodle-proformasubmexport and
* `responsedownload`:  https://github.com/elearning-ostfalia/moodle-responsedownload

are avaliable.

#### Streaming

Some PHP files send event driven texts to the browser (server sent events). In order for this to work properly, adjustments may have to be made to your web server.

E.g. when using Apache and proxy_fcgi add the following lines (or similar) to your php???-fpm.conf file:

    ProxyPassMatch "^/path/to/moodle/question/type/proforma/upload_sse\.php$" "fcgi://localhost" enablereuse=on flushpackets=on
    ProxyPassMatch "^/path/to/moodle/question/type/proforma/checksolution_ajax\.php$" "fcgi://localhost" enablereuse=on flushpackets=on

## Settings


### Admin settings

At least the following settings must be made:  

* set grader URI to IP address and port number of your 'ProFormA-Praktomat server'

* Moodle 4: Ensure that the servers (IP and port) are not blocked by HTTP security ("cURL blocked hosts list" and "cURL allowed ports list").

and for the built-in Java question generator: 

* set Java version
* set Checkstyle version
* set JUnit version

There is a simple test for the connection between Moodle and Praktomat in the settings page where the grader URI is set. If you press the `save changes` button the connection is checked and in case of an error the error message is displayed.

### Sample

The following steps describe how you can create a simple Java question. You should always test your question by actually sending a correct submission to the grader. 

* Go to an existing course (or create one)
* Go to the question back
* press `Create a new question...`
* select `ProFormA Task`
* If a selection dialog is visible then select Java and press 'ok'
* Fill in: `Question name` =`Test Question`, `Question text` = `test`
* Go to `1. JUnit Test` and enter `Title` = `JUnit`
* Enter the following code into the JUnit Test editor: 
 
        import static org.junit.Assert.*;
        import org.junit.Test;

        public class PalindromTest {
        
            @Test
            public void testRentner() {
                assertEquals("Rentner", true, MyString.isPalindrom("Rentner"));
            }
        }        

* Set `Response filename` to `MyString.java`
* Press `Save Changes`
* Select `Edit` -> `Preview`
* Enter the follwing code into the editor:

        public class MyString {
            
            static public Boolean isPalindrom(String aString) 
            {
                String reverse = new StringBuilder(aString).reverse().toString();
                return (aString.equalsIgnoreCase(reverse));
            }
        }

Then you should see:

![Test Feedback](doc/testfeedback.PNG "Test Feedback")



### Quiz settings

In order to display the grading feedback to the student you need to set the following 
options in your Moodle quiz:

* Question behaviour: `Adaptive` (with our without penalties) for displaying immediate feedback
  or `deferred feedback` if the student  shall not see any feedback 
* Review Options: `Specific Feedback` set to `on` for showing detailed grading results
* Review Options: opt out `Right Answer` if you do not want to show the model solution


### Miscellaneous

#### Bulktest 

With the bulktest index you get a list of all courses using ProFormA questions. 

        <your moodle site>/question/type/proforma/bulktestindex.php

By clicking on a course you run a bulk test of all ProFormA questions in this course using the associated model solution.

This script can also be used by a teacher or manager. He or she only gets a list of his or her course(s).
